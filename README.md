# Restful API Router 


## Explanation
Eliminates the need for using cumbersome RESTful routes by providing a simple/easy means to matching URIs to a resource(s).


#### Added Benefits
1. Provides a routing management system to catalogue routes.
2. Decouples the client from the server. As such, the server is free from holding data/state.


#### In plain words:
It is designed to forward API Server request from one central point.

#### Oracle says:
".........The Router API provides a mechanism for routing
 API requests intended for API Servers......"
